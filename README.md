A Full-stack JavaScript application built using Node, Express, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

## User Stories

- I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
- The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
- When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

## Technolgies
To handle the file uploading use [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
